Soutenue par le comte de Rochefort, qui part porter secours aux assiégés de La Rochelle, elle s'engage à participer à l'assassinat du duc de Buckingham. D'Artagnan, Athos, Porthos et Aramis parviennent à échapper à de multiples attaques mais ils ne réussissent pas à empêcher la mort du Duc. Le cardinal de Richelieu parvient cependant à prendre La Rochelle et les quatre mousquetaires se lancent alors au secours de Constance, retenue prisonnière dans un couvent. Ils arrivent cependant trop tard et découvrent le corps de Constance, assassinée par Milady. Ils signent alors l'arrêt de mort de cette dernière qui, une fois capturée est livrée à la hache du bourreau de Lille.","popularity":19.847,"poster_path":"/kf4unnj46WV5XCr5KUBtffneX1Z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1262,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Trust
