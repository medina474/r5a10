Afin de lui prouver que les monstres ne vivent que dans son imagination, son grand frère Brian lui propose d'échanger leurs chambres pour un soir. Et soudain, au beau milieu de la nuit, Brian s'aperçoit qu'il n'est pas seul : un monstre vit réellement sous le lit ! Grâce à beaucoup d'astuces, il parvient à le capturer. Son nom est Maurice. Il est très laid et facétieux... mais terriblement sympathique. Maurice, qui craint la lumière, ne peut sortir que le soir pour faire peur aux enfants, et accomplir les pires bêtises. Il va faire découvrir à Brian, son nouvel ami, le monde fantastique et délirant d'où il vient...","popularity":18.108,"poster_path":"/oCC9piloeSMRpaGgxv52NfxM3vo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1302,"logo_path":"/zC3b70ixHh89qJIikLQPEvLqbPM.png","name":"Davis Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":6092,"logo_path":null,"name":"Licht/Mueller Film Corporation","origin_country":""},{"id":12360,"logo_path":"/EugVVMfcbv9zxCr0C60VhD0vGY.png","name":"Vestron Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1989-08-25","revenue":793775,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Little Monsters","video":false,"vote_average":5.845,"vote_count":187,"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6054,"name":"friendship"},{"id":1299,"name":"monster"},{"id":3501,"name":"bed"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2223,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Savage","original_name":"Fred Savage","popularity":23.933,"profile_path":"/ux4TBPjG2kZDUlDiKb6eBK7BBFl.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Brian Stevenson","credit_id":"52fe463d9251416c75071d07","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77920,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Howie Mandel","original_name":"Howie Mandel","popularity":14.143,"profile_path":"/lX5HyGJ6X6aVPwirx5Tt9CJcMzA.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Maurice","credit_id":"52fe463d9251416c75071d0b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11511,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Stern","original_name":"Daniel Stern","popularity":25.561,"profile_path":"/qLLM1a9BmafnlDmgIwYwJW1DThq.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Glen Stevenson","credit_id":"52fe463d9251416c75071d0f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":60700,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret Whitton","original_name":"Margaret Whitton","popularity":12.541,"profile_path":"/AaeGGScxFyAHQuKzYrNbSxw05iR.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Holly Stevenson","credit_id":"52fe463d9251416c75071d13","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1538,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rick Ducommun","original_name":"Rick Ducommun","popularity":7.204,"profile_path":"/KVqsDHntPAYZgzFGHWuPDzLTsi.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Snik","credit_id":"52fe463d9251416c75071d17","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28166,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Savage","original_name":"Ben Savage","popularity":8.826,"profile_path":"/khiml4TCvzUkTZUfhOiaWPTjKzy.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Eric Stevenson","credit_id":"52fe463d9251416c75071d1b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11516,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Devin Ratray","original_name":"Devin Ratray","popularity":15.447,"profile_path":"/iWUBK0pCfTAQrqYMLIEZXk4ZLwZ.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Ronnie Coleman","credit_id":"52fe463d9251416c75071d1f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1212268,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amber Barretto","original_name":"Amber Barretto","popularity":5.421,"profile_path":"/zpQFKo7TxpjluGULabltt1NBNTi.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Kiersten","credit_id":"5d0bc3d90e0a264871c9a427","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11805,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Whaley","original_name":"Frank Whaley","popularity":27.714,"profile_path":"/fYcqfn6nQy8qO40DMBdDzWQuloq.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Boy","credit_id":"5f33d4b929c62600365e6c1c","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1026656,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"William Murray Weiss","original_name":"William Murray Weiss","popularity":1.721,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Todd","credit_id":"5f33d4f529c62600355cd0b6","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11797,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.
