Il recommence immédiatement la série de ses vols et escroqueries. Cependant, il doit composer avec Marie-Charlotte Pontalec, déléguée permanente d'assistance post-pénale nommée par le juge d'application des peines. Victor et Marie-Charlotte ne tardent pas à éprouver une attirance réciproque, ce qui n'empêche pas Victor de chercher, à l'instigation de son oncle Camille, son père spirituel, à profiter de sa proximité avec Marie-Charlotte pour dérober un triptyque signé du Greco, après l'avoir vu au musée de Senlis, dont le père de Marie-Charlotte est conservateur. Mais la jeune femme finira par découvrir la vérité et le plus filou ne sera pas forcément celui auquel on pense de prime abord.","popularity":9.11,"poster_path":"/wPh04mxo0Nrtw9fLcwNvV0ohgox.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":175455,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mondex Et
